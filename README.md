# Rock-paper-scissor

### The project for this repository is to create a rock paper scissor game. This utilizes really basic css to change button size and color, while using javascript to have an interaction with the buttons and enable the user to play against a computer. The winner of the match is when the computer or player has won a total of 5 rounds.
